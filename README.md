# Mocha
A minimalist, peer-to-peer blogging and social networking platform inspired by the principles of Diaspora and the decentralized nature of the web.

## Key Features
- Decentralized Nodes: Each user runs their own node, capable of posting content and aggregating posts from users they follow across the network.

- Inbox Model: Posts are actively sent to followers' inboxes rather than passively polled. This design simplifies synchronization and mimics the essence of ActivityPub's "push" model.

- Content Aggregation: Authors can follow others across different nodes, pulling their shared content into a local feed.
